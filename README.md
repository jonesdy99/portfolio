Title: This project is a base portfolio that checks all the basic boxes of having everything on the website that an employer may want to know.

Getting Started: https://djones-portfolio-8f1580.netlify.app <---- Deployed website
Trello: https://trello.com/b/mSJtmE8t/portfolio-dylan-jones

Next Steps: Flesh out the project work section more as I currently don't like the layout or look of it. Maybe do something different with mobile versions as well, adding more features.
